🚀 Project Name
🔎 Overview

This project was developed over a span of 10 days as part of a learning and implementation exercise. The aim of the project is to [briefly describe your goal, e.g., build an image-processing fire detection system using Raspberry Pi].

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, NumPy, etc.

Hardware (if any): Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, Sensors

Tools: VS Code, GitHub, etc.

📅 10-Day Work Log

Day 1 → Project planning, requirements gathering, and environment setup.

Day 2 → Installed dependencies and tested libraries/hardware connections.

Day 3 → Basic code structure created with initial testing.

Day 4 → Implemented core functionality (e.g., object detection / feature extraction).

Day 5 → Debugging and refining algorithms for accuracy.

Day 6 → Added additional modules (e.g., alert system / display output).

Day 7 → Integrated hardware components (camera, sensors, display).

Day 8 → Tested end-to-end system with sample inputs.

Day 9 → Documentation, bug fixes, and optimization.

Day 10 → Final testing, demo preparation, and project completion.
