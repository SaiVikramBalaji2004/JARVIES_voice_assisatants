## 📅 10-Day Work Log

* **Day 1** → Project planning, requirements gathering, and environment setup.
* **Day 2** → Installed dependencies and tested libraries/hardware connections.
* **Day 3** → Basic code structure created with initial testing.
* **Day 4** → Implemented core functionality (e.g., object detection / feature extraction).
* **Day 5** → Debugging and refining algorithms for accuracy.
* **Day 6** → Added additional modules (e.g., alert system / display output).
* **Day 7** → Integrated hardware components (camera, sensors, display).
* **Day 8** → Tested end-to-end system with sample inputs.
* **Day 9** → Documentation, bug fixes, and optimization.
* **Day 10** → Final testing, demo preparation, and project completion.
